This repo is not a programming related repo but included in my course during my studies in University of Orl√©ans.
I will be presenting a topic called "Quantum Theory" and usually on Monday I will be working on it until the day of my presentation. 

If you have any problems or any ideas(before the day of my presentation), please do not hesitate to contact me.

I do not own any media contents included in the repo except for the information on my slide that I researched it with the sources mentioned in handout.odt. I will try my best to quote as much sources as I could. 

My objective: Make it as fun as I could, but not funny.
